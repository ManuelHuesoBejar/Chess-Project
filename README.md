## First Steps
Download GIT CMD and VS.

Using GIT CMD you have to register yourself with your e-mail address associated to the repo:
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
git config --global user.name "NAME INITIALS ON CAPITAL LETTERS(I.E.: MHB)"

I recommend use the 3 name initials on capital letters because it will be easier to work here in group. Also it is faster for commit and push.
